# Gender-Recognition
Model for gender recognition using CNN, Python, Keras and OpenCV

  ***Detector.py*** contains code that is required to built model
  
  ***dataset*** folder containing our dataset images required for training and testing.
  
  ***VideoTester.py*** to test our trained model
  
  ***plot.png*** graph represent loss/accuracy against number of epochs during training of the model


Accuracy is almost up-to-the mark but if accuracy need to increased then model should be re-trained on more epochs (approx 100). It is now trained on 50 epochs.
