# Gender-Recognition
Model for gender recognition using CNN, Python, Keras and OpenCV

  ***Detector.py*** contains code that is required to built model
  ***dataset*** folder containing our dataset images required for training and testing.


Accuracy is almost up-to-the mark but if accuracy need to increased then model should be re-trained on more epochs (approx 100). It is now trained on 50 epochs.
